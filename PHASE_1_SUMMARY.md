## Questions?

### "What's business-use percentage?"
For mixed-use expenses (like your vehicle or phone), you can only deduct the portion used for business. Track your business km vs total km to calculate this accurately.

### "What's ITC eligible?"
If you're registered for GST/HST, you can claim Input Tax Credits on eligible business purchases. This reduces the GST/HST you owe.

### "Can I change my entries later?"
Yes! All expenses can be edited or deleted. The audit trail keeps track of changes for compliance.

### "What about receipts?"
Phase 6 will add photo upload and OCR. For now, keep physical/digital receipts organized separately.
