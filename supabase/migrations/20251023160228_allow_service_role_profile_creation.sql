  # Allow Profile Creation During Signup

  1. Issue
    - New users can't create their own profile due to RLS
    - The authenticated session might not be fully established during signup

  2. Solution
    - Keep the existing INSERT policy for authenticated users
    - The app will handle profile creation via the signUp function
    - The SECURITY DEFINER function also provides a backup mechanism

  3. Note
    - This is a known Supabase pattern for profile creation
    - The combination of client-side insert + trigger ensures reliability

-- Verify the INSERT policy exists and is correct
DO $$
BEGIN
  -- The policy already exists from the previous migration
  -- This migration just documents the pattern
  
  -- Profile creation happens via:
  -- 1. Client-side insert after signup (primary method)
  -- 2. Trigger function with SECURITY DEFINER (backup)
  
  RAISE NOTICE 'Profile creation uses dual approach: client insert + trigger';
