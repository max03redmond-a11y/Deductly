## 🎯 Key Features Implemented

### Plain-Language Guidance
✅ Every category includes:
- Short explanation surfaced in UI
- Detailed rules in modal
- T2125 line reference
- ITC eligibility indicator
- Business-use % guidance
- Pro tips with CRA-compliant copy

### Business-Use % Handling
✅ Categories automatically flag whether business-use % applies
✅ Default percentages set per category (100% or 50% for meals)
✅ User can override with custom percentage
✅ Real-time calculation of deductible amount

### GST/HST Support
✅ Separate tracking of tax paid
✅ ITC eligibility flagged per category
✅ Foundation for ITC calculation (requires mileage for business-use %)

### Clean UI
✅ Wealthsimple-style design
✅ Every action ≤2 taps
✅ Category selection with visual feedback
✅ Inline help with expandable details
✅ Real-time amount calculations

## 📊 Database Functions
Helper functions created:
- `compute_business_use_pct(user_id, year)` - Calculate business-use % from mileage
- `calculate_itc(tax, business_pct, eligible)` - Compute Input Tax Credits

## 🔐 Security
✅ RLS enabled on all tables
✅ Users can only access their own data
✅ Audit trail is append-only
✅ All amounts validated with CHECK constraints

## 📁 Files Created/Modified

### New Files:
- `/supabase/migrations/20251016000000_cra_compliant_expense_system.sql`
- `/hooks/useCRACategories.ts`
- `/components/CategorySelector.tsx`
- `/components/EnhancedExpenseModal.tsx`

### Modified Files:
- `/types/database.ts` - Enhanced types
- `/app/(tabs)/expenses.tsx` - Integrated new modal

## 🎨 UI Copy (CRA-Compliant)
All user-facing text follows CRA guidelines:

> "Apply business-use %. We'll use your mileage to right-size vehicle and phone costs."

> "Meals for riders only are 50% deductible. Personal meals aren't deductible."

> "Lease and loan interest have CRA monthly caps; we'll apply them automatically."

> "Keep receipts for 6 years. We timestamp and store them for you."

- [ ] Check deductible amount calculation
- [ ] Test business-use % override
- [ ] Verify data saves to enhanced schema

## 💡 Implementation Highlights

1. **Incremental Approach:** Started with high-value feature (enhanced categories) rather than trying to build everything at once.

2. **Database-First:** Proper schema with computed columns, constraints, and helper functions ensures data integrity.

3. **User Experience:** Every category has contextual help, removing the need for external CRA documentation lookup.

4. **Extensibility:** Schema supports future features (CCA, mileage tracking, ITCs) without requiring migrations.

5. **Type Safety:** Complete TypeScript coverage ensures compile-time error catching.

## 🎯 Business Value Delivered

- **Compliance:** Every expense category maps to specific T2125 lines
- **Education:** Users learn CRA rules while entering expenses
- **Accuracy:** Separate tax tracking enables precise ITC calculations
- **Audit Trail:** Complete change history for CRA audits
- **Scalability:** Foundation supports advanced features (CCA, reports, exports)
